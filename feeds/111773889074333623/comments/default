Probably read the same talking points memo as she did. He says if there had been no Deep Throat, Nixon wouldn&#39;t have fallen, and had Nixon not fallen, South Vietnam wouldn&#39;t have fallen, and had South Vietnam not fallen, the Khmer Rouge would not have taken over in Cambodia. The most straightforward response is to point out that had Nixon not broken the law, there would have been no need for a Deep Throat. Beyond that, one might point out other factors that led to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, including, most importantly, Nixon&#39;s secret bombing of Cambodia. &lt;BR/&gt;I&#39;m also intrigued by the right&#39;s argument that liberals are hypocrites for praising Felt but excoriating Linda Tripp, as though the little Clinton-Lewinsky episode of &quot;Cheaters: Caught on Tape&quot; were equivalent to Watergate. Look at the high standard of moral conduct to which they hold Democratic presidents, and the low standard they hold for Republicans!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/111773889074333623/comments/default/111868219316416223'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/111773889074333623/comments/default/111868219316416223'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2005/06/is-it-always-this-stupid.html?showComment=1118682180000#c111868219316416223' title=''/><author><name>will</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2005/06/is-it-always-this-stupid.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-111773889074333623' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/111773889074333623' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1416398708"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:03 AM, June 13, 2005"/></entry></feed>
