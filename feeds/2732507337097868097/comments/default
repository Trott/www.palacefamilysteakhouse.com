Wrong time. But there is no doubt that people would comment on its excellence despite being &quot;old fashion&quot;.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And there are plenty of works whose primary strength is &quot;timeliness&quot; (or novelty) and over a longer period of time, their shine fades. I think much of the catalog of Beck falls into this category.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In the 20th and 21st century things get a bit more complex, because of the sheer volume of works - old ones re-discovered, re-mastered, re-sold; new ones shoved out the door. Sales figures compete with artistic merit.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Frequently what makes art valuable in retrospect isn&#39;t the work itself but what it triggers/triggered, and represents/represented. The Sex Pistols or The Pixies, for example, or any other band that is better appreciated for the bands they inspired.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I can&#39;t support any &quot;algorithmic greatness model&quot;. Artistic greatness is a cultural thing and thus unpredictable. I think it&#39;s possible to make reasonable guesses about what the public and/or critics may like in the near-term, but there really is no way to guess what will endure for 10, 50, 100 years.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Classical music (or &quot;Western Art Music&quot;, if you prefer) is already a dead and embalmed thing. There is no progress, no innovation. Its best works lie behind it and its popularity (such as it is) rests as much or more with its cultural associations and reputation than its future.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sadly, Jazz and rock are not far behind. And last time I checked, hip-hop had seen better days.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Comparing &lt;I&gt;The Marshall Mathers LP&lt;/I&gt; to &lt;I&gt;Pierrot Lunaire&lt;/I&gt; is entertaining but pointless, sort of like asking &quot;who would win in a fight: TJ Hooker or Odysseus?&quot; These are works aimed at listeners separated by hundreds of years, cultures, and expectations.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Any assignation of &quot;value&quot; or &quot;merit&quot; to either work is inherently subjective and wholly dependent on the values with which the listener approaches each work.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My money&#39;s currently on Schoenberg for a few reasons: Schoenberg did it all himself, Eminem relied on many other talents to create his work (not even counting the samples).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Schoenberg was stretching the edges not just of &quot;good taste&quot;, but of his genre and music as a whole. Nothing about Eminem&#39;s record puts it out on that edge (I&#39;d look more to someone like Dalek, but even they&#39;re not far-out enough).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Finally, Schoenberg&#39;s work inspired powerful reaction, pro and con, in the press but in the music world as well. Perhaps it&#39;s just the much shorter temporal distance, but Eminem&#39;s effort has yet to demonstrate that level of influence.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Of course, now I&#39;m thinking I should make a hip-hop version of &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot; which is all based around samples of Schoenberg. (Though ideally the Insane Clown Posse would be best act to do this.)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I mean, come ON. In one of the &lt;I&gt;Pierrot&lt;/I&gt; segments, the crazy clown drills a hole into some dude&#39;s head, sticks his Turkish tobacco in there, and uses the guy&#39;s skull as a pipe for smoking...while the guy is still alive.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;That&#39;s hardcore. That shit would make the &lt;B&gt;Geto Boys&lt;/B&gt; &lt;I&gt;and&lt;/I&gt; &lt;B&gt;Cypress Hill&lt;/B&gt; run for their mommies.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I&#39;ma start this right away!</content><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='21' src='http://www.chillproductions.com/anu/web/me.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2009/03/quantifying-greatness-in-music.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-2732507337097868097' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/2732507337097868097' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-583873635"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:00 PM, March 15, 2009"/></entry></feed>
