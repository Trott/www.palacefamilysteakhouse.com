I Don&#39;t Care Who Imagined IT and Build IT and Made IT Come into Being! Screw Them!&quot;  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Yeah, that&#39;s a great attitude. It&#39;s not like I attacked anybody...just made my opinion known because I am always a guardian of Mr. Trott&#39;s Ideals and Treasures. He is free to ignore my opinion. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Assuming Lloyd Bentsen pose:  &quot;Anu, I know Mr. Trott. Mr. Trott is a friend of Mine. And, you ANU, are NO Mr. Trott.&quot;  That has it&#39;s upside of course...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And I have no doubt when it comes to Trottophilia and True Patreiot Love for PFSH, this person is a mixed-up neophyte...and, moreover, does this person even know The Gambling Poet?  I doubt it. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;That alone, makes this sort of dismissive missive a poor joke...a travesty to the memory of GNABO and Tested: Jerry and Palmdale&#39;s Freedonian All-Stars-- all things that Anu has never heard of. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And -- worst of all -- he doesn&#39;t even care. Shias, Sunnis -- bah -- I don&#39;t need to know these pesky details -- I live in the Steakhouse now...it&#39;s ALL MINE.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Moreover, how did this guy get into the PFSH mailroom in the first place?  Is this some kind of Hudsucker Proxy event?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sadly, Anu, one cannot recreate the past dear friend, nor can one chuck out the precedents of past greatness -- that is, unless your name is George W. Bush.  Great is Great and Ignorance is Ignorance.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I was there at Club LatinAmerican avec Monsieur Trott, performing bad bar theater in the last century when you were doing something else...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And...hmmm...when I review the HALLOWED ROSTER OF FOUNDING MEMBERS OF PALACE FAMILY STEAK HOUSE in January 2005...I see no &quot;Anu&quot; on that list...maybe you had something better to do that night, like washing the cat or catching a re-run of MASH...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your &quot;history&quot; of Boomers, Whigs and Dot Commers merely indicates that you and your confrere Mr. Bush have no interest in facts and history. Which is extremely unfortunate.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I, on the other hand, was there in the Brilliant company of Gambling P, CD Player and The Trott...rather than &quot;dissing&quot; your &quot;elders&quot; you might seek wisdom from them...as I have from Gambling P and Mr. Trott.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I wish you the best with your endeavors!
