A few years ago, I would have been jumping up and down, saying things like &quot;art isn&#39;t always accepted in it&#39;s time&quot;.  But now, I tend to agree with most of this.  Serialism was a technique gone mad, and the composers wore that technique not on their sleeve but on their fucking foreheads!  It&#39;s not like we sit there listening to Webern saying &quot;Oh, I love the retrograde inversion transposed to the 4th degree in the cello!&quot;  Anyone who tells you that they can hear the rows is just playing with themselves.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But we can&#39;t blame a technique for the failures of High/Late Modernism.  For me, it&#39;s a lot more on the surface.  First problem:  there&#39;s nothing for you to follow.  Sure, Schoenberg&#39;s 4th Qt has &#39;themes&#39;, and so does Berg.  But what about Boulez Structures?  It&#39;s a homogeneous work (2 pianos), so it&#39;s a blank slate as far as timbre.  After a while, it&#39;s just a bunch of notes.  The same is true of almost all of Davidovsky&#39;s music - just a bunch of notes.  We, the listeners (should that have been singular?) are trying to grasp something - an interval, a sustained note, something that repeats (ah, but Modernism forbids repetition). There&#39;s no hierarchy - we don&#39;t know what the piece is &#39;about&#39;.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Second problem (related to 1st):  harmony, or lack thereof.  We don&#39;t hear clear and distinct harmonic units in most H/L Modernist works.  12-counting doesn&#39;t &#39;count&#39;.  Even when we do get a sustained chord in Babbitt, for instance, he quickly runs away from it - because the music has no hierarchical framework.  (Curiously, when I started writing music with long sustained chords or notes, modernist composers often complained about that feature.)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Serialism, and most of the mid-century techniques like it, are for the composer&#39;s workbench.  Most of us don&#39;t know (or care) how the piece was constructed, but it seems like you can&#39;t listen to H/L Modernism without that knowledge.  And then:  when we ARE privy to that knowledge, does it make it more enjoyable?  Do we really understand the piece, or do we just think we do?</content><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2005/06/still-here-i-go.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-111895976923403434' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/111895976923403434' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-916072207"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:27 PM, June 28, 2005"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-111904203274296649</id><published>2005-06-17T14:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-06-17T14:00:00.000-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I just puked in my mouth a little.</title><content type='html'>I just puked in my mouth a little.</content><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2005/06/still-here-i-go.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-111895976923403434' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/111895976923403434' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1840614687"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:00 PM, June 17, 2005"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-111903011195334182</id><published>2005-06-17T10:41:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-06-17T10:41:00.000-07:00</updated><title type='text'>It&#39;s occurs to me that this scientific-advancement...</title><content type='html'>It&#39;s occurs to me that this scientific-advancement idea that serious music had for two hundred years is a bit silly. In my college Music History courses, there was this attitude of &quot;and then we developed this music, and then we added strict tonality, and then improved things further with longer forms, bigger orchestration, more instruments...&quot; almost as if everyone was just workin&#39; on this giant project entitled, &quot;the greatest type of music ever.&quot; Each composer, dutifully contributing to the metaphorical floor of the metaphorical building project that serious music composition had become.  Meanwhile, although it appears that serious music underwent something that could be looked at as &#39;progressive&#39; in many of its aspects between about 1750 to the early 20th century, there is also the issue of the actual music that was produced.  Turns out lots of people were busy hating the crap out of it; it&#39;s almost as if the logical conclusion of music &lt;B&gt;progressing&lt;/B&gt; from generation to generation (as opposed to just &lt;B&gt;changing&lt;/B&gt;) was crappy music that no one wanted to listen to or pay for.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;After all, isn&#39;t it the case that the only people in the world who listen to serial music voluntarily are composers?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But none of this means that you can&#39;t learn a great deal about composing music from trying your hand at Serialism. I sure did. I don&#39;t listen to any of those pieces anymore, exactly, but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t a worthwhile effort. You just have to know when to stop, that&#39;s all.</content><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2005/06/still-here-i-go.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-111895976923403434' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/111895976923403434' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1618860583"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:41 AM, June 17, 2005"/></entry></feed>
