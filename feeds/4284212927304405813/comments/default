I think Zappa and the Residents fall mostly outside of those parameters.  They were reactions/responses to those scenes.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But even if one thinks they should be included, hyperbole must gloss over the exception here or there.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Lastly, while I&#39;m a fan of the Residents and Zappa, I think the assertion that they &quot;didn&#39;t suck&quot; is debatable.  Both of those acts frequently sucked.  That&#39;s what happens when you have a long and experimental career; some experiments fail and result in sucky product.  (On the other hand, in 1967, Zappa had not yet sucked.  But the Residents hadn&#39;t released anything yet, I don&#39;t think, so they&#39;d be off the table.)</content><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2007/06/answering-la-vs-sf-hyperbole-with-more.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-4284212927304405813' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/4284212927304405813' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1304895333"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:50 AM, June 24, 2007"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-3631399438489957740</id><published>2007-06-24T02:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-24T02:31:00.000-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Umm, you&#39;re forgetting Frank Zappa.

If you detected sarcasm, you&#39;ve misread me.  When I say the California bands &quot;sucked,&quot; that&#39;s hyperbole.
