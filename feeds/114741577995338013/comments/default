There&#39;s an intro which tries to be very respectful of the band, but then there are reports from several of the participants and they sound pretty darn snarky. For instance: &quot;The dimunitive, bearded lead singer especially seemed to bask in the glory, maybe for the first time truly doing his best frontman impression.&quot; I&#39;m sure I&#39;d feel made a fool if I was in this band. &lt;BR/&gt;But then again, doesn&#39;t every rock experience have an element of put-on to it these days? Even if we&#39;re not being self-consciously ironic (or outright sarcastic, as the improv people may have been), aren&#39;t we sort of camping it up? I mean, even 14 year old metal heads aren&#39;t entirely serious when they flash the devil-horn hand signal these days? &lt;BR/&gt;I don&#39;t know what to think about it.</content><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2006/05/ira-glass-gets-me-thinking.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-114741577995338013' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/114741577995338013' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-42679685"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:01 PM, May 30, 2006"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-114884304425192378</id><published>2006-05-28T12:04:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-05-28T12:04:00.000-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I am a regular there, and I asked the owner about ...</title><content type='html'>I am a regular there, and I asked the owner about it, and she was not angry or upset but seemed kind of amused and supportive! Her daughter emailed her from scotland to say that she had heard about it. She was quite surprised but mentioned some guys who used to get steak sandwiches climbing on tables looking for power for a video camera. She noted that the odd thing was that they had not been back! I would go in and keep them up to date, and I am sure it will be fine.</content><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2006/05/ira-glass-gets-me-thinking.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-114741577995338013' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/114741577995338013' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1416398708"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:04 PM, May 28, 2006"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-114862752335492623</id><published>2006-05-26T00:12:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-05-26T00:12:00.000-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Well, it would help if the lyrics were &quot;the food&#39;s...</title><content type='html'>Well, it would help if the lyrics were &quot;the food&#39;s so good&quot; instead of &quot;no good&quot;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Th eirony being that the food is actually quite good in my opinion...then again I am not a veg...</content><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/2006/05/ira-glass-gets-me-thinking.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11363368.post-114741577995338013' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11363368/posts/default/114741577995338013' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1416398708"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:12 AM, May 26, 2006"/></entry></feed>
